Great job! Let’s take a look at the result one last time:

SELECT * 
FROM friends;


create table friends (
  id INTEGER,
  name TEXT,
  birthday DATE
);

insert into friends (id, name, birthday) 
values (1,'Jane Doe', '1990-05-30');

insert into friends (id, name, birthday)
values (2, 'Anas', '1994-07-20');

insert into friends (id, name, birthday)
values (3, 'Anas', '1994-07-20');

update friends
set name = 'Jane Smith'
where id = 1;

alter table friends
add column email TEXT;

update friends
set email = 'jane@codecademy.com'
where id = 1;

select * from friends;
