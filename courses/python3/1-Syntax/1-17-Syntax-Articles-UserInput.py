User Input
How to assign variables with user input.

So far, we’ve covered how to assign variables values directly in a Python file. However, we often want a user of a program to enter new information into the program.

How can we do this? As it turns out, another way to assign a value to a variable is through user input.

While we output a variable’s value using print(), we assign information to a variable using input(). The input() function requires a prompt message, which it will print out for the user before they enter the new information. For example:

likes_snakes = input("Do you like snakes? ")
In the example above, the following would occur:

The program would print “Do you like snakes? “ for the user.
The user would enter an answer (e.g., “Yes! I have seven pythons as pets!”).
The variable likes_snakes would be assigned a value of the user’s answer (in this case, “Yes! I have seven pythons as pets!”).
Try constructing a statement to collect user input on your own!

Fill in the blanks in the code to complete a statement that asks a user “What is your favorite flightless bird?” and then stores their answer in the variable favorite_flightless_bird.

favorite_flightless_bird = input("What is your favorite flightless bird?")

Not only can input() be used for collecting all sorts of different information from a user, but once you have that information stored as a variable you can use it to simulate interaction:

>>> favorite_fruit = input("What is your favorite fruit? ")
What is your favorite fruit? mango
>>> print("Oh cool! I like " + favorite_fruit + " too, but I think my favorite fruit is apple.")
Oh yeah! I like mango too, but I think my favorite fruit is apple.
These are pretty basic implementations of input(), but as you get more familiar with Python you’ll find more and more interesting scenarios where you will want to interact with your users.
