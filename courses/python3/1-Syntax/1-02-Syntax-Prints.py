Now what we’re going to do is teach our computer to communicate. The gift of speech is valuable: a computer can answer many questions we have about “how” or “why” or “what” it is doing. In Python, the print() function is used to tell a computer to talk. The message to be printed should be surrounded by quotes:

# from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein
print("There is something at work in my soul, which I do not understand.")

In the above example, we direct our program to print() an excerpt from a notable book. The printed words that appear as a result of the print() function are referred to as output. The output of this example program would be:

There is something at work in my soul, which I do not understand.
