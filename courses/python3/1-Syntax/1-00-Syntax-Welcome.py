Welcome
Python is a programming language.
Like other languages, it gives us a way to communicate ideas.
In the case of a programming language, these ideas are “commands” that people use to communicate with a computer!

We convey our commands to the computer by writing them in a text file using a programming language.
These files are called programs. Running a program means telling a computer to read the text file, translate it to the set of operations that it understands, and perform those actions.
